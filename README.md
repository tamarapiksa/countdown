COUNTDOWN TIMER 

This application runs a countdown timer from the current date and time to the end of 2016. Once the time runs out, an alert with the message "Happy New Year!" will appear.<br>

1. I spent about 90 minutes on this project.<br>

2. I chose React because I have been working with React recently and it is simple to use.<br>

3. I would make the design responsive. I would refactor my CSS with SASS. I would also change the components that don't have state to be stateless functional components. <br>

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
